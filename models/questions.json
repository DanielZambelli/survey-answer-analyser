      { "id":"Q1A3", "answer": "Mastering Evernote for me was a game changer. Some place that I could just toss all of the information I had, quickly label it, and move on.

      { "id":"Q1A4", "answer": "Necessity is the mother of invention as the saying goes. You want to maximize your efforts so you are always trying to improve productivity. This is accomplished by reducing steps, applying the best techniques, using the appropriate tools, etc" },
      { "id":"Q1A5", "answer": "There is a 20/80 rule that says that 20% of your efforts produces 80% of the results and 80% of your efforts ends in only 20% results." },
      { "id":"Q1A6", "answer": "In my opinion, working smarter and not harder means taking time to analyse the task in order to come up with the most efficient way of getting that task done rather than diving into the task haphazardly and working until it is done. Diving straight into the task may yield the same result but a lack of planning usually leads wasted time and effort." }
